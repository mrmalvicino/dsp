# Digital Signal Processing Package

&nbsp; The [DSP package](https://github.com/mrmalvicino/dsp) provides a set of tools for digital signal processing in Python. It is designed to facilitate the generation, manipulation, and visualization of signals, as well as the application of filters and signals processing.

## Features and core modules

&nbsp; This package pretends to simplify signal processing by alowing the user to manipulate signals as objects.

### Signal Module

&nbsp; Signal is the core class of the package, representing a signal in both the time and frequency domain. It allows manipulation of attributes such as fundamental frequency, amplitude, phase, and provides methods to load spectrums from files and modify the signal duration.

### Generator Module

&nbsp; The Generator class is used to create and combine signals. It offers methods to generate sinusoidal waves, unit impulses, and more. It also allows the summation of signals, creating new combinations of waveforms.

### Grapher Module

&nbsp; The Grapher class handles signal visualization. It provides methods to plot waveforms, frequency spectrum, and visualize multiple signals clearly.
